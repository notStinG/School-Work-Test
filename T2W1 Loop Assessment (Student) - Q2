## Question 2
## Variables
height = None
total = 0
count = 0

## Inputs
while height != "quit":
    height = input("Enter height (in m), or 'quit' to exit: ")
    if height == "quit":  ## If quit then exit the loop
        break  
    else:
        total += float(height) ## adding height to total immediately
    count += 1                 ## counting number of people

## Calculation and printing results
if total == 0:
    print("There is no input.") ## Nothing added
else:
    mean = round(total / count, 2) ## mean height formula
    print(f"The mean height of the {count} people is {mean} m (2 dp).") ## Mean height printed
